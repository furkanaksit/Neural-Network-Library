# Neural-Network-Library
A small version of a neural networks library, developed for neural networks course in Yildiz Technical University
---

Neural Network library is a generic library that has following features:

  * There are two activation funtions and their derivatives. (sigmoid - relu)
    - Activation functions are represented as function list so adding new activation function and their derivative is quite easy.
  * Layer structure can be developed similar to keras.
  * For now only sthocastic gradient descend algorithm is supported and it is being used as default.
  * Error function needs some correcting. It is my number one priority in future plans.
  * For train and test, I think it is a generic form but it will need a second check.

Please don't forget this was a course project in a semester with 7 other courses and 6 other course projects. So i only had 4 weeks to finish all my 6 course projects. 

It will be developed in time by me as a side project to understand the main algorithms behind neural networks. I think it is important to learn what algorithms do to use them. It will allow me to debug better when i face a problem.
